# Handling inbound voice calls with Python

This repo provides an example of how to handle inbound calls in Python.

Three scenarios are covered:

1. Play Text-to-speech message.
2. Connect inbound call to second phone (call forward).
3. Scenarios 1 and 2 plus also plays audio stream into call (also shows how to transfer control of call to new NCCO).

## Prerequisites

To run the code you need:

1. Python 3 installed
2. A Nexmo application + Nexmo number
3. Ngrok (for testing locally, or other deployment method)

## Blog post

Full details will be provided in a blog post coming soon.
